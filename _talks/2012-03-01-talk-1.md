Focal or arm-level amplification of the oncogene NKX2-1 (chr14q13) and/or loss of heterozygosity at chr14q occurs in 12-53% of lung cancers3, and there are currently no molecularly targeted small molecule therapeutics for these alterations. We have recently developed novel compounds targeting the mitochondrial insertase OXA1L, encoded adjacent to NKX2-1 at chr14q11, which is collaterally amplified or deleted along with NKX2-1 across ~10% of samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, Figure 2a,b). Importantly, these compounds are selectively lethal in human cancer cell lines predominantly expressing an OXA1L polymorphism that occurs in ~25% of humans (S419(AGC)5, rs148216086, Figure 2c-d), and acquired resistance to these compounds is conferred through amplification of the wild type (WT) OXA1L allele on chr14q (Figure 2e,f). Mechanistically, selective lethality occurs due to partial inhibition of OxPhos, which increases OxPhos-coupled de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis through dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), resulting in imbalanced nucleotide pools. Consistently, ectopic expression of WT OXA1L in heterozygous cells collaterally increases sensitivity to the pyrimidine antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, Figure 2e). Based on these data, we hypothesize that NKX2-1 amplification impinges on OXA1L dosage and allelic balance, affecting the efficacy of both our novel OXA1L compounds, as well as established inhibitors of nucleotide metabolism (Figure 2g).
