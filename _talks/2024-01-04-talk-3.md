Focal or arm-level amplification of the oncogene NKX2-1 (chr14q13) and/or loss of heterozygosity at chr14q occurs in 12-53% of lung cancers, and there are currently no molecularly targeted small molecule therapeutics for these alterations. We have recently developed novel compounds targeting the mitochondrial insertase OXA1L, encoded adjacent to NKX2-1 at chr14q11, which is collaterally amplified or deleted along with NKX2-1 across ~10% of samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, Figure 2a). Importantly, these compounds are selectively lethal in NKX2-1 amplified human cancer cell lines, owing to partial inhibition of OxPhos and increased OxPhos-coupled de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Based on this mechanism, we seek to validate OXA1L as a target in chr14q amplified and deleted cancer cells and animal models, understand additional vulnerabilities associated with altered pyrmidine biosynthes and further establish structure activity reliationships governing OXA1L inhibitor selectivity.
