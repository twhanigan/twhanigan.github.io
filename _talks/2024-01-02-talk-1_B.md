To balance biosynthesis and bioenergetic homeostasis, adenine nucleotides are incorporated into numerous intermediary amino acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and vitamins, which function as orthosteric substrates and cofactors, and/or allosteric ligands that can activate catabolic enzymes when energy levels are depleted. In general, adenine nucleotide binding motifs include a protein loop where the amino acid backbone hydrogen-bonds with N6 and N1 of the Watson-Crick edge, an acidic amino acid to interact with ribose, and series of positional polar amino acids that hydrogen bond with the phosphate(s), magnesium phosphate, and/or additional distal substituents (Figure 4a), with adenine affinity primarily driven by electrostatic interactions. While orthosteric adenylate binding motifs are conserved, our preliminary analysis of published structures suggests that key differences have evolved in allosteric binding sites (Figure 4b). While allosteric sites retain the hydrogen bond pairing with adenine and ribose, the angle of the sugar and substituent distal to the 5’-ribose hydroxyl is rotated relative to the plane of adenine in comparison to a U-shaped or linear extended conformation in active sites. Moreover, allosteric sites are enriched in hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids distal to the 5’-ribose hydroxyls. In this project, we will use structure-based drug design and photoaffinity labeling to synthesize small molecule libraries biased towards allosteric catabolic enzymes and develop chemical biology platforms to delineate functional liganding events that modulate catabolic flux for treatment of metabolic disease.
