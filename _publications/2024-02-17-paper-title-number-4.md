excerpt: 'Significance: This work demonstrates that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor selectivity and efficacy is regulated by HDAC phosphorylation and characterizes a novel pathway catalyzing HDAC3 phosphorylation mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase, differentially active across breast cancer subtypes. Thus, the selectivity and efficacy of HDAC inhibitors is cell type-dependent, which is not recapitulated in vitro analysis, and provides a strategy to improve HDAC inhibitor efficacy for breast cancer treatment.'
