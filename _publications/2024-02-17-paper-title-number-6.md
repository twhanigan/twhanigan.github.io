excerpt: 'Significance: In this study we describe a robust synthetic strategy to access chemically diverse photoreactive probes (PRPs), which we used to prepare PRPs based on seven HDAC inhibitor scaffolds. The selectivity of these PRP chemotypes for HDAC isoforms was characterized by biochemical assays and photolabeling experiments in cell lines and mouse liver tissues, relevant for the design of isoform selective HDAC inhibitors.'
