1367.e8. doi:10.1016/j.chembiol.2017.08.015. 
Significance: This work demonstrates that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor selectivity and efficacy is 
regulated by HDAC phosphorylation and characterizes a novel pathway catalyzing HDAC3 phosphorylation 
mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase, differentially active across breast cancer subtypes. Thus, the selectivity 
and efficacy of HDAC inhibitors is cell type-dependent, which is not recapitulated in vitro analysis, and provides 
a strategy to improve HDAC inhibitor efficacy for breast cancer treatment.

Significance: This work describes a novel method applying photoreactive HDAC inhibitors for chromatin 
immunoprecipitation, which permits characterization of genomic loci specifically targeted by HDAC inhibitors.

Significance: In this study we describe a robust synthetic strategy to access chemically diverse photoreactive 
probes (PRPs), which we used to prepare PRPs based on seven HDAC inhibitor scaffolds. The selectivity of these 
PRP chemotypes for HDAC isoforms was characterized by biochemical assays and photolabeling experiments in 
cell lines and mouse liver tissues, relevant for the design of isoform selective HDAC inhibitors.
