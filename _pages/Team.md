        <strong>Dimos Koinas - Postdoctoral Fellow</strong>
        <p>PhD. University of Illinois at Chicago.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 10px;">Dimos was born in Athens, Greece, and earned his Bachelor’s/Pharm.D. degree from the University of Patras. He later moved to London, UK, where he obtained his M.Res. in Drug Discovery and Development from Imperial College London. There, he worked with Prof. Matthew J. Fuchter on the design and synthesis of Rev-Erb inhibitors for NK-Cell immuno-oncology therapies. Continuing his academic journey in the US, he joining the laboratory of Prof. Karol S. Bruzik at the University of Illinois Chicago where he obtained his Ph.D. During his time there, they discovered, characterized, and developed the first Null Allosteric Ligands (NAL) for GABAAR, pioneering a new area of the NAL pharmacology. In the Spring of 2025, Dimos joined Prof. Thomas Hanigan’s lab at the University of Houston as a Postdoctoral Fellow, where he focuses on cancer and metabolic disease models. Outside of the lab, Dimos enjoys traveling, biking, reading, and spending time with friends. Fun fact: Dimo-sthenis means people’s power. Also, Deimos is a moon of Mars.</p>

        <strong>Win Wijitrmektong - Postdoctoral Fellow</strong>
        <p>PhD. University of Houston.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 10px;">Wissarut (Win) Wijitrmektong is a pharmacist with extensive experience in pharmaceutical and analytical chemistry, as well as quality management systems, with a particular focus on late-stage pharmaceutical drug product development. Driven by a strong passion for early-stage drug discovery, he recently earned a Ph.D. in Medicinal Chemistry from the University of Houston in 2024 under the mentorship of Dr. Gregory Cuny, where his doctoral research focused on structure-based drug optimization and the synthesis of kinase inhibitors targeting CDPK1, a protozoal kinase in Cryptosporidium parasites, for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis. As a recent graduate, he is eager to pursue new opportunities to enhance his expertise in chemical biology and computer-aided drug design, with the ultimate goal of becoming a leader in the field, developing innovative therapeutics that address unmet clinical needs and improve human health. For leisure Win enjoys watching movies/series, exercise, table tennis, swimming, and dancing, as well as exploring new cafes and restaurants.</p>
