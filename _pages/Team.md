**Wissarut (Win) Wijitrmektong-Postdoctoral Fellow**

My name is Wissarut Wijitrmektong, a pharmacist with extensive experience in pharmaceutical and analytical chemistry, as well as quality management systems, with a particular focus on late-stage pharmaceutical drug product development. Driven by a strong passion for early-stage drug discovery, I recently earned a Ph.D. in Medicinal Chemistry from the University of Houston in 2024 under the mentorship of Dr. Gregory Cuny. My doctoral research focused on structure-based drug optimization and the synthesis of kinase inhibitors targeting CDPK1, a protozoal kinase in Cryptosporidium parasites, for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis. As a recent graduate, I am eager to pursue new opportunities to enhance my expertise in chemical biology and computer-aided drug design, which are increasingly pivotal in modern drug discovery. My ultimate goal is to become a leader in the field, developing innovative therapeutics that address unmet clinical needs and improve human health. My leisure activities are watching movies/series, doing exercise e.g., table tennis, swimming, and dancing, as well as exploring new cafes and restaurants.

**Hiring**

**Research Technicians**

We are seeking motivated research technicians who wish to conduct chemical biology research and/or gain experience as an independent researcher. Candidates should have a bachelor degree in chemistry, biology, biochemistry, or related area. If you are interested, please email a cover letter, CV, and contact information for three referees to [thanigan@central.uh.edu](mailto:thanigan@cougernet.uh.edu?subject=Postdoc%20Applicant). In your CV, please indicate your research experience, skill set and career goals.

**Postdoctoral Scholars**

We are actively looking for post-doctoral researchers with experience in in chemical biology, proteomics, organic synthesis, biochemistry, and/or bioinformatics. Specific expertise in multi-component synthesis, enzyme inhibitor development, and/or metabolism oriented chemical biology is desirable. If interested, please email [thanigan@central.uh.edu](mailto:thanigan@cougernet.uh.edu?subject=Postdoc%20Applicant) with your CV, contact information for three referees and a brief description of how you might fit into one or more of the ongoing lab projects.

**Graduate Students**

University of Houston graduate students who are interested in chemical biology research are welcome to email [thanigan@central.uh.edu](mailto:thanigan@cougernet.uh.edu?subject=Postdoc%20Applicant) with your CV and brief description of how your research interests. Graduate students are expected to gain multidisciplinary training in proteomics, molecular biology, biochemistry and synthetic chemistry, with translational impact on cancer and metabolic disease. For prospective graduate students, please apply to the University of Houston PPS graduate program.
