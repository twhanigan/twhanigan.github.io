        <strong>Wissarut (Win) Wijitrmektong - Postdoctoral Fellow</strong>
        <p>PhD. University of Houston.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 10px;">Driven by a strong passion for early-stage drug discovery, I recently earned a Ph.D. in Medicinal Chemistry from the University of Houston in 2024 under the mentorship of Dr. Gregory Cuny. My doctoral research focused on structure-based drug optimization and the synthesis of kinase inhibitors targeting CDPK1, a protozoal kinase in Cryptosporidium parasites, for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis. As a recent graduate, I am eager to pursue new opportunities to enhance my expertise in chemical biology and computer-aided drug design, which are increasingly pivotal in modern drug discovery. My ultimate goal is to become a leader in the field, developing innovative therapeutics that address unmet clinical needs and improve human health. My leisure activities are watching movies/series, doing exercise e.g., table tennis, swimming, and dancing, as well as exploring new cafes and restaurants.</p>
